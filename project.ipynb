    "### First Question:\n",
    "**How does the choice of feature scaling technique affect the performance of regression algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Importance: \n",
    "Feature scaling plays a crucial role in many regression algorithms, as it can affect convergence speed and model accuracy. Investigating the impact of different scaling methods helps in selecting the most appropriate preprocessing technique.\n",
    "##### Approach: \n",
    "Apply various feature scaling methods such as Min-Max scaling, Standardization, and Robust scaling to both synthetic and real-world datasets. Evaluate the regression algorithms' performance with each scaling method in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample error.\n",

    "### Second Question:\n",
    "**How do ensemble methods compare to single classifiers in handling complex decision boundaries and improving classification accuracy?**\n",
    "##### Importance: \n",
    "Ensemble methods combine multiple base classifiers to achieve better performance than any individual classifier alone. Understanding their effectiveness in different scenarios aids in selecting the most suitable approach for classification tasks.\n",
    "##### Approach: \n",
    "Compare the performance of ensemble methods such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Bagging with single classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) on synthetic and real-world datasets. Evaluate classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the benefits of ensemble learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third Question:\n",
    "**How does the complexity of regression models affect their interpretability and generalization to unseen data?**\n",
    "##### Importance: \n",
    "Interpretable models are crucial for understanding the underlying relationships between features and the target variable. However, more complex models might sacrifice interpretability for improved performance. Understanding this trade-off is essential for model selection.\n",
    "##### Approach: \n",
    "Train regression models of varying complexities (e.g., linear regression, polynomial regression, neural networks) on synthetic and real-world datasets. Evaluate the models' interpretability using techniques such as feature importance analysis, partial dependence plots, and model-agnostic methods like SHAP values. Compare the interpretability and generalization performance of different models."
